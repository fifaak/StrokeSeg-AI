## Introduction

StrokeSeg AI leverages deep learning to segment and reconstruct brain strokes from CT scan images. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing faster and more accurate stroke detection, specifically focusing on hemorrhagic strokes. The U-Net architecture, paired with a ResNet encoder, enhances the model's ability to detect stroke-affected regions with high precision.

## Key Features

- **U-Net with ResNet Encoder**: Combines the U-Net model with ResNet encoders (ResNet50/ResNet101) for improved feature extraction and segmentation accuracy.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Generates 3D visualizations from segmented slices for a comprehensive view of stroke regions.
- **Fast Inference**: Provides segmentation results in under 20 seconds, significantly faster than traditional diagnostic methods.
- **Web-based Application**: Deployable on cloud platforms, with a user-friendly web interface accessible by medical professionals.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes a U-Net architecture with a pre-trained ResNet encoder, optimized for medical image segmentation. Key components include:

- **Encoder**: Uses pre-trained ResNet50/ResNet101 models for enhanced feature extraction.
- **Decoder**: U-Net decoder that upsamples encoded features to generate segmentation masks.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained on ImageNet to improve training efficiency and accuracy.
